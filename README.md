## **This is Just For You**

In today's age, it seems almost impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel. With COVID-19 running amuck, it's hard to remain sane nowadays. Social media provides people with a sense of community and purpose. It is more important to tend to our mental and physical health than it ever has been, yet platforms don't pay much mind to such things. There needs to be more focused towards this topic and attend to users who are in need. That is why this is Just For You.

With Just For You, we plan on providing you with a community dedicated towards you, you and **you**.

This is just the beginning.
