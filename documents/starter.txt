Group 5 project proposal

Group Members: Bryce, Ziad, and Richard

Project Title: Just For You

Target Audience: General public focused on self-wellness. Any age.

Project Details: In today's age, it seems almost impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
With COVID-19 running amuck, it's hard to remain sane nowadays. Social media provides people with a sense of 
community and purpose. It is more important to tend to our mental and physical health than it ever has been, 
yet platforms don't pay much mind to such things. There needs to be more focused towards this topic and attend 
to users who are in need. That is why this is Just For You. Just For You focuses on the user to a very individual 
level, asking them questions in regards to their eating habits, mood, and overall mental health. Features include:

Daily health recommendations
Community forums based on user preferences
Progress page
Local community event scheduler
Much more

Ideally with Just For You, we plan on providing you with a community dedicated towards you, you and you. 
The goal of this is to provide each user with a comforting experience and a platform that provides them access 
with people just like them locally or globally. To be the best you, you must take care of yourself first. 
We hope to be able to thoroughly integrate a ML assistant service that provides each user with a health recommendation 
agent and route them to communities they may enjoy being a part of or possibly even local facilities for them to talk 
to someone. This is a very ambitious project, however we have nothing but the best intentions for people in need.

Technologies:	HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, PHP, XAMPP
